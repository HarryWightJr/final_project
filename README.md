# Final Project

## Content

The topic we have selected was to examine crime rate data and housing price data by city and create a machine learning tool to see if we could create an environment that would predict housing price based on the level of crime that occurs in a given city.

The topic was selected out of a mutual interest in finances, crime/crime rate data, and how it may affect the housing market and where people choose to live.


## Communication Tools Used

* Day-to-day text communication was done using the Slack communication platform.
* Group meetings are held over Zoom meetings on webcam to share ideas and to work more intricately on the project.
